# ice-crh-1column
Repository intended to contain codes, calculations and figures included in the manuscript "Ice crystal complexity leads to weaker ice cloud radiative heating in idealized single-column simulations", submitted to Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics journal (https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3212/) UNDER REVIEW.

Group of folders and codes 1 to 3, and "interscheme_comparison" folder are kept without change unless corrections are required by referees and editor, as these files have all calculations and figures used in the main manuscript and supplementary material documents. Folder 4 and "explorative_versions" folder could be edited in the future to evaluate and compute other parameters related with- but not used in the manuscript submitted to the journal.
