v7a (2024-07-23)
Includes gases:
1. As one scalar: CO2 = 390.1ppm, CH4 = 1.8ppm, N2O = 322ppb, O2 = 0.20942ppm, from 2012 climatology used in ICON run simulations. (Potential test in the future, with vertical distribution of gases (7b)).
2. New format figures with logscale colorbar.
3. IWP range in logscale.
4. Effective radii range with higher resolution.

v6 (2023-07-21)
Fixed:
    1. Radiative Transfer Model: ecRad
    2. cos_sza = 0.6 (Effective solar zenith angle of 53 degrees, (Wallace&Hobbs 2006))
    3. SW albedo = 0.05 (Hartmann&Berry, 2017).
    4. LW emissivity = 0.97 (REFERENCE?)
    5. Skin temperature as surface temperature (~300 K, (Jin&Dickinson, 2010))
    6. No gases and aerosols.
    7. No liquid water.
    8. Tropical Sounding Climatology (Temperature, Pressure and Specific Humidity) (Lapse Rate of 6.7 K/km).
Variables:
    1. Macro: Temperature (Altitude-position) -> 236 K to 201 K
    2. Macro: Geometrical Depth Dh -> 0.5 km to 5 km every 0.25 km (Nellore, Kannan, Vellaisamy 2019).
    3. Macro: Ice Water Path (IWP) -> 0.1 to 1000 g/m^2, with 30 g/m^2 for fixed value (Around Anvil Cirrus IWP typical value (Sokol & Hartmann 2020)):
        IWP \;=\; \int{IWC\;dz} \;=\; \int_{h_1}^{h_2}{q_i\;\rho(z)\;dz} \;=\; 30\;\frac{g}{m^2}\;\;\; , \;\;\;(h_2 - h_1 = \Delta h \;(km))$$

        where IWC is the Ice Water Content $(g/m^3)$, which is the Ice Water Mixing Ratio $q_{i}\;(g/kg)$ times the density $\rho(z)$:

        $$\Rightarrow\;q_i = \frac{30\;g/m^2}{\int_{h_1}^{h_2}{\rho(z)\;dz}}$$
    4. Micro: Effective Radius $r_e$ = 30 $\mu m$ (Hartmann & Berry, 2017).

        3.2 Yi et al. 2013 (2O)

        3.4 Baran et al. 2014 (4O)
    6. Solvers: Tripleclouds.
Other main changes: 
    1. np.gradient instead of np.diff(y)/np.diff(x) for CRH calculation.
    2. 'RdBu_r' instead of 'seismic' for colorbars.
    3. Correction of q_i calculation.
